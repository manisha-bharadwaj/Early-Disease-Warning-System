# 🧬 Disease Spread Early Warning System

A futuristic, real-time public health surveillance dashboard designed to detect disease outbreaks early, visualize regional risk, and support healthcare decision-making.

This platform works like **“Google Maps for Disease Spread”** — combining symptom intelligence, analytics, hospital capacity monitoring, and geo-risk visualization into one unified command center.

## 🚀 Features

### 🧾 Anonymous Symptom Intelligence Survey

* Multi-select symptom reporting
* Severity tracking
* Exposure & travel history
* Vaccination status
* Age group analytics
* Scrollable cyber-medical UI form

---

### 📊 Live Health Analytics Dashboard

* Daily case trend visualization
* Symptom distribution analysis
* Infection growth monitoring
* Risk zone ranking panels

Built using interactive chart libraries for real-time insights.

---

### 🏥 Hospital Capacity Monitor

Displays nearby hospital readiness including:

* Total beds available
* ICU capacity
* Oxygen beds
* Ventilator count
* Current patient load
* Availability status indicators

Helps authorities plan emergency response.

---

### 🗺️ Disease Risk Map

* India-centered surveillance map

* Polygon outbreak zones

* Risk color coding:

  🔴 Severe
  🟠 Moderate
  🟢 Low

* Popup case data per region

---

### 🚨 Auto Location Health Alerts

* Detects user GPS location on site load
* Triggers outbreak risk alerts
* Displays detected location on dashboard
* Simulates real surveillance early-warning systems

---

## 🧠 System Workflow

User submits symptom data
→ Data analyzed regionally
→ Risk score generated
→ Dashboard analytics update
→ Map polygons visualize outbreaks
→ Alerts triggered for affected users
